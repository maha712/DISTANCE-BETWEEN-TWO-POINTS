# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two points.
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import math package
### Step 2: 
input number 1
### Step 3: 
input number 2 Substitute the values in the distance formula formula
### Step 4: 
formula : distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
### Step 5: 
### PROGRAM:
print the distance in two decimal

import math

l2 = [10,6]

l1 = [4,2]

nce = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))

print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
### OUTPUT:
